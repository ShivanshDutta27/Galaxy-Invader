**Description**:
Galaxy Invader is a space-themed 2D shooter game where the player controls a spaceship that must defeat waves of enemies. The player and enemies both shoot bullets, and each entity has varying health. The goal is to prevent enemies from reaching the bottom of the screen, which leads to a loss. The game includes a boss enemy with enhanced abilities and unique behavior.
